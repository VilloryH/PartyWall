# Firestore Sample

This sample demonstrates how to use Firestore. At the moment, it only contains
code that shows how to use the `@FirestoreQuery` property wrapper.

## How to use

1. Install the Firebase emulator suite (see https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure for details)
2. Launch the local emulator suite by running the `run.sh` script in this folder
3. You can now run `FirestoreSample` on a local iOS Simulator, the app will communicate with the local Firebase Emulator suite
